# MiniFlow

MiniFlow is a lightweight C++ library for creating neural networks. It is inspired by the simplicity and design of the Python [MiniFlow library](https://github.com/karpathy/miniflow) and adapts its core concepts to C++. The goal of MiniFlow is to provide an intuitive, modular framework that makes it easy to experiment with neural network architectures and training routines in C++.

## Overview

MiniFlow offers a simple API for constructing, training, and evaluating neural networks in C++. Whether you are looking to learn about neural network fundamentals or integrate custom network components into a larger C++ project, MiniFlow provides a minimal framework to get you started.

Key features include:

- **Simplicity:** Minimalistic design for easy understanding and extension.
- **Modularity:** Separate components for data, network layers, and training routines.
- **Extensibility:** Easily integrate custom layers and training algorithms.

---

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **BostonData/**  
  Contains sample datasets (for example, the Boston Housing dataset) to experiment with network training and evaluation.

- **MiniFlow/**  
  May include example scripts and demo applications that illustrate how to use the library.

- **MiniFlowLib/**  
  Houses the core library source code. This is where the building blocks of the neural network (such as layer definitions, forward/backward propagation routines, etc.) are implemented.

- **NeuralNetwork/**  
  Contains higher-level implementations and sample neural network architectures that utilize the MiniFlowLib components.

- **MiniFlow.sln**  
  A Visual Studio solution file to help build and run the project on Windows.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2019 or later is recommended for Windows users).
- CMake (if you plan to build on non-Windows platforms; see below for notes).
- Standard C++ libraries (the project uses C++11/14 features).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkivHisink/MiniFlow.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**

   ```bash
   cd MiniFlow
   ```

3. **Open the Project**

   - **Windows:** Open `MiniFlow.sln` in Visual Studio and build the solution.
   - **Other Platforms:** (If applicable) Create a CMake project or makefile based on the provided source code.

---

## Usage

Below is a simple example of how you might use MiniFlow in your own C++ project:

```cpp
#include "NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.h"

int main() {
    // Create an instance of your neural network
    NeuralNetwork nn;

    // Configure your network (e.g., add layers, set learning rate)
    nn.addLayer(new DenseLayer(10, 5));  // Example: from 10 inputs to 5 neurons
    nn.addLayer(new ActivationLayer("relu"));

    // Load sample data from the BostonData folder (implementation-specific)
    DataSet trainingData = DataLoader::load("BostonData/training.csv");

    // Train the network
    nn.train(trainingData, /* epochs */ 100, /* learning rate */ 0.01);

    // Evaluate the network
    double accuracy = nn.evaluate(trainingData);
    std::cout << "Training Accuracy: " << accuracy << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

*Note:* The above code is illustrative. Adjust class names and function calls based on the actual implementation provided in MiniFlowLib and NeuralNetwork folders.

## Building the Project

- **Windows:**  
  Open `MiniFlow.sln` with Visual Studio and build the solution.

- **Linux/macOS:**  
  If you prefer to use CMake, create a `CMakeLists.txt` file (if not already provided) and configure your build environment. For example:
  
  ```cmake
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
  project(MiniFlow)

  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

  # Add directories containing the library source files
  add_subdirectory(MiniFlowLib)
  add_subdirectory(NeuralNetwork)

  # Add your executable target and link against the library targets
  add_executable(MiniFlowDemo MiniFlow/main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(MiniFlowDemo PRIVATE MiniFlowLib NeuralNetwork)
  ```

Then, run:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
